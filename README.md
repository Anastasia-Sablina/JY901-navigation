This project tries to implement inertial navigation using JY901(S), and the controller is ESP8266 (Whether it shall be changed into stm32 or FPGA is still under consideration, since 8266 is cheapest). Moreover, a ROS2 package will be provided.

 ## Structure

Main branch contains codes and required instructions in each folder. Reference branch contains required knowledge to understand the project. If references are links, they are attached in [References](#References).



## Progress

July. 17th, 2022: Run demo of JY901S, and finish constructing [HTML documentations](https://www.sablin.top/HTML/jy901/files.html). However, I still cannot obtain something mentioned in the pdf manual (Such as quaternion ).
